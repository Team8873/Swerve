# Swerve
This repository contains a basic swerve reference implementation. This is heavily insipred by the [Swerve Bot Example](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib/tree/main/wpilibjExamples/src/main/java/edu/wpi/first/wpilibj/examples/swervebot) from [WPILib](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib). Emphasis has been placed on a slightly more modern coding style as well as easy and centralized configuration. There are no magic numbers in this codebase.

## Note
This code is not production ready as-is. All PID constants, drive train sizes, and speed limits must be set for the specific robot you plan to use this with.
